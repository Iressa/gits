# Some C code from Ghost in the Shell (1995).
In the scene with the the three robot women typing, you can see C code on one of their screens.
The file gits.c tries to show what was there.
The code appears to be from a paint program of some sort.

I am very unsure of what lines 28 and 35 actually say.

## More.
The code that Dr. Willis was seen writing can be found from [this repository by nullgemm](https://github.com/nullgemm/ghck).
